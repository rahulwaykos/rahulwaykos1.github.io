                                    <h2 id="what-is-containers">What is Containers</h2>
<p>Containers!!!! This terminology is booming around last few years from now. So before moving to our topic of interest, let&rsquo;s talk about actual physical containers. Containers is what we used to store the shipment of packages. Packages can be anything from small parts to big ones that needed to be shipped from one place to another. Why we use it?  We can categorize the packages depending on sizes, color etc. This help us to hassle free shipment instead of stack of mixed packages or products.
Software containers are the same. Instead of using the whole operating system and then run your software, simply put the code and its dependencies in container and run it anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="why">WHY?</h2>
<p>Before the containers, VMs i.e. Virtual Machines were go-to technology for deployment of softwares, running serers to host applications which are isolated from each other. The cost behind this is high because resources like os, hardwares needed to use servers for different applications. As containers come handy, a single host can run multiple containers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/first.png" alt="First"></p>
<p>Containers can do virtualization at the OS level while VMs do at the harware level. Containers in single host share the same kernel. As containers are lihtweight. In a microservices-based design, the approach taken is split a single application into multiple small independent components and run each components as Container. Docker, Podman, Rkt, LXC are some examples of Container runtime implementions.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each container is isolated from other containers runnning on same host.</li>
<li>Portability</li>
<li>More efficient</li>
<li>Less costly</li>
<li>Can run in any env like Production, development and testing</li>
</ul>
